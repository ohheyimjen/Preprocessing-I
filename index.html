    <h2>Listen pup</h2>
    <p>In general, dogs are unequivocally regarded as "man's best friend".
      I like to think I put those dogs to shame, by also being a woman's, cat's, bird's, 
      and ironing board's best friend, too! I've been told that ironing board one is an odd pride, but those things 
      are TERRIFYING, and extremely difficult to tolerate at all, so I think it's pretty impressive. 
      Hire me, and we'll discover all the pawssibilities of things I can be best friends with!
